  \itemize{
    \item Add \code{parseExample} from earlier upstream announcement (Dirk).
    \item Synced with upstream (Brendan in \ghpr{12}) closing \ghit{11}).
    \item Updated example \code{parseExample} to API changes (Brendan).

\section{Changes in version 0.0.4 (2020-04-03)}{

\section{Changes in version 0.0.3 (2020-03-03)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Sychronized once more with upstream.
    \item Created new C++ function to check for unsupported
    architecture, and report the status on package load.
    \item Only run example and unit tests if supported architecture is
    found. 
    \item Created small \code{configure} script to see if R was built
    with C++17 support, and record it in \code{src/Makevars}.

  \itemize{
    \item Sychronized with upstream (Dirk in \ghpr{4} and \ghpr{5}).
    \item The R side of \code{validateJSON} now globs the file argument,
    expanding symbols like \code{~} appropriately. 
    \item C++ code in \code{validateJSON} now conditional on C++17
    allowing (incomplete) compilation on lesser systems.
    \item New helper function returning value of \code{__cplusplus}
    macro, used in package startup to warn if insufficient compiler used.
  }

  \itemize{
    \item Initial CRAN upload of first version
